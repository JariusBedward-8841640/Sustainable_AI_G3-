    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "- With the rapid growth of AI systems, there has been a rise in electricity consumption, water, usage, and infrastructure stress in data-center regions around the world. With over a thousand new AI-driven data centers built in 2025 alone, these centers are extremely resource intensive and bring with them significant environment and regulatory challenges. Currently, organizations lack the practical tools for measuring or predicting the energy consumption of prompt design and model usage at the application level. The project aims to bridge the gap by developing a methods to estimate the prompt energy consumption usage and support more transparent, efficient and sustainable AI workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Project Objective:\n",
    "- We set out to design and implement a tool that promotes sustainable AI usage by estimating and reducing the energy cost of user prompts. To achieve this we developed a streamlit based chatbot application built in Python that analyzes a prompt, evaluates it's structure and characteristics such as word count, character count, token count and predict its' estimated energy consumption using machine learning models trained on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The application supports sustainable prompt practices but generating and recommending an optimized version of the user's prompt that preserves the original meaning while reducing complexity which would result in lower energy cost.\n"

    "\n",
    "4. To accomplish our goal, our methodology involved dataset construction, feature engineering, model training and interface development to create a system capable of estimating and visualizing prompt level energy usage. We needed to be able to have prompts that also have energy readings to be able to train the model so it could understand the relationship between prompt complexity and energy usage. We then needed to be able to visualize the data to interpret how well our models are performing and what we can do to better tune them.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We imported a hugging face dataset that contains text from yelp reviews, which was the base for generating optimized version of prompts as well as understanding how much energy consumption a prompt would take. While the prompts were real, the energy metrics as well as other metrics were not available. To fix this, we designed a formula to produced synthetic but meaningful targets. The generated labels allow us to create a controlled environment for testing and how text complexity could influence predicted resource usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Just because the energy readings are synthetic does not make the project void as well. The program is designed to be able to just simply swap out datasets and if the energy reading is provided within the dataset it would be able to read it and the models would be trained based on that new data with accurate energy readings.\n",
